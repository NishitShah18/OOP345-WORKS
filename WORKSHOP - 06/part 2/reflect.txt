Autheticity Declaraition :
I declare that I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the
code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.
*************************************************************************/

This workshop was fairly simple, and concepts were not difficult to grasp and apply, and I gained experience dealing with static and dynamically allocated objects. This workshop also taught me how to use vectors effectively. During the workshop, I had some difficulties working on the File and Filesystem modules, particularly when using certain functions, but to overcome this, I went through lecture recordings and received some assistance from my online tutor to ensure that my concepts were clear and that my solution was as good as it could be.

When we do not deallocate dynamically allocated memory in a vector, we get a memory leak and an error in the heap summary during compilation.

If we create a different solution with functions that identify errors and correct the type of data that the programme accepts by comparing it to a given text file, the function NodeType type() can figure out what went wrong.

It's possible that we should use vectors rather than pointer types for std::vectorsdds::Resource> because vectors allow us to enter and store any data or element while also allowing us to delete that data or element when necessary. I'm not sure why, but I believe using pointers is a better method.

Overall, working on the workshop I learned a lot of new concepts and the workshop was bit time consuming but it was fun.
