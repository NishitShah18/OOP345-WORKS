Subject Title
Object-Oriented Software Development Using C++

Subject Description
This subject expands the student's skill-set in object-oriented programming and introduces the student to threaded programming.  The student learns to model relationships between classes using containers, inheritance hierarchies and polymorphism in the C++ programming language and to write C++ programs that execute on multiple threads.

Credit Status
1 credit (3 units)
Required for CPA - Computer Programming and Analysis (Ontario College Advanced Diploma)
Required for CPD - Computer Programmer (Ontario College Diploma)

Learning Outcomes
Upon successful completion of this subject the student will be able to:

Design collections of model objects using sequential containers and multi-dimensional arrays to solve a systems or business problem
Create function objects and closures to customize a programming solution for a particular application
Model generalization and specialization using inheritance hierarchies to minimize the duplication of code
Model polymorphic behavior using interfaces, virtual functions and templates (generics) to amplify the reusability of code
Implement design components using algorithms of the standard template library to utilize existing technologies
Create program components of quadratic complexity to solve non-linear problems
Design program components using raw pointers and pointer arithmetic to access data in program memory
Design multi-tasked solutions using threading libraries to improve the performance of a program
Design file stream objects to backup text and binary data for future restoration
Essential Employability Skills
    •  Execute mathematical operations accurately.
    •  Apply a systematic approach to solve problems.
    •  Use a variety of thinking skills to anticipate and solve problems.
    •  Locate, select, organize, and document information using appropriate technology and information systems.
    •  Analyze, evaluate, and apply relevant information from a variety of sources.
    •  Interact with others in groups or teams in ways that contribute to effective working relationships and the achievement of goals.
    •  Manage the use of time and other resources to complete projects.
