# Subject Title

Object-Oriented Software Development Using C++

<hr>

# Subject Description

This subject expands the student's skill-set in object-oriented programming and introduces the student to threaded programming.  The student learns to model relationships between classes using containers, inheritance hierarchies and polymorphism in the C++ programming language and to write C++ programs that execute on multiple threads.
